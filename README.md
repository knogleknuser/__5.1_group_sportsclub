# Sportsclub database java application

This piece of code is an example on how to apply CRUD operations on
a Postgres database from Java through jdbc.

The code is written for 2. semester on the Datamatiker education in Lyngby.

The code is NOT refactored.

## Exercises

Your task is to continue the work that has been started.
We need to get some useful queries built into the system, and also
datamappers for some of the other databases.sportsclub.entities in the database.

### Get started

1) Begin by cloning the project
2) After cloning, remove the .git folder by typing `rm -rf .git`.
3) Open the project in IntelliJ
4) Create the database 'sportsclub' in Postgres via pgAdmin
5) Open the file "src/main/resources/sportsclub.sql" in pgAdmin and execute it to create the sportsclub tables and fill them with data.
6) Update the login credentials in the Main class to reflect your local system
7) Run it and get to know the code.

### Add some nice queries

Add some of these methods to the MemberMapper class. As many as you can, and begin
querying in Workbench to fine tune your sql-statements:

7) Find the number of participants on each team
8) Find the number of participants for each sport
9) Find the number of men and women in the club
10) Find the total sum of income for all teams
11) Find the total sum of income for each team
12) Find the average payment for each team

Hint: It might be useful to create a view with lots of joins

### Add a RegistrationMapper

13) Add a new class in the persistence package called "RegistrationMapper"
14) Add a method that can be used to add a new registration to a member. For example as `addToTeam(int member_id, String team_id, int price)`. 
    Your test could be to add the team called "ten01" to member 13. You should probably let your self be inspired 
    by the insertMember method in the MemberMapper.
15) Add a new method to the RegistrationMapper called getAllRegistrations() that returns an arraylist of registrations.
16) You might want to pimp the getAllRegistrations so that you can print out more
    than just the (member_id, team_id) data. It would be lovely with a list of member names
    and team name etc. Use you imagination.
